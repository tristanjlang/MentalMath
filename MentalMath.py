import random

'''
Randomly generate two numbers:
-50% chance the number is a whole number vs percent with 1 decimal place
-if the first number is a whole number, the second must be a percent

Prompt user for input:
-If the result is "quit" then end the loop
-If the result is correct, tell them
-Display the total time the user took to work on the problem

Wait 3-5 seconds, then loop back through and get two new numbers
